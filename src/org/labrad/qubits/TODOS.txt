- reload wiring whenever it changes in the registry (and reset it if this fails)

- construct memory and SRAM for each fpga that will be run (before deconvolution)
  so that we don't run spurious sequences on partially used boards.

- make dual-block sram delay part of the SRAM calls, not the memory calls
  (for dual-block sequences, this is the only thing that changes,
  so it is silly to require to regenerate the whole memory sequence)
  
- add timing data postprocessing options (e.g. cutoffs, deinterlace, multi-qubit combine, discard all but 000..., etc.)
