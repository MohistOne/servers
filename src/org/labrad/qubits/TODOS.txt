- reload wiring whenever it changes in the registry (and reset it if this fails)

- make dual-block sram delay part of the SRAM calls, not the memory calls
  (for dual-block sequences, this is the only thing that changes,
  so it is silly to require to regenerate the whole memory sequence)
  
- add timing data postprocessing options (e.g. cutoffs)
