- need to finalize interface for loading qubit config info.  Do we want a fixed registry location, or relative only?

- construct memory and SRAM for each fpga that will be run (before deconvolution)
  so that we don't run spurious sequences on partially used boards.

- add timing data postprocessing options (e.g. cutoffs, deinterlace, multi-qubit combine, discard all but 000..., etc.)
