Units:
Get trace with units = Volts pk
Get trace with units = volts rms
Get trace with units = dbV
Both traces had same noise floor and sampe peak shape and height

Measure:
Get trace as SPECTRUM
Get trace as PSD
Both traces look the same when returned by device

Compare SPECTRUM and PSD:
Span: 12.5Khz
Linewidth = 31.25Hz = Span/400
Start Freq = 43.75KHz
Center Freq = 50KHz
SPECTRUM = 46.12 nVrms
PSD = 5.963 nVrms/rtHz
SPECTRUM/PSD = 7.73
so... PSD ~ SPECTRUM/(2*linewidth)
