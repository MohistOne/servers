Units:
Get trace with units = Volts pk
Get trace with units = volts rms
Get trace with units = dbV
Both traces had same noise floor and sampe peak shape and height

Measure:
Get trace as SPECTRUM
Get trace as PSD
Both traces look the same when returned by device

Compare SPECTRUM and PSD:
Span: 12.5Khz
Linewidth = 31.25Hz = Span/400
Start Freq = 43.75KHz
Center Freq = 50KHz
SPECTRUM = 46.12 nVrms
PSD = 5.963 nVrms/rtHz
SPECTRUM/PSD = 7.73
so... PSD ~ SPECTRUM/sqrt(2*linewidth)

I do not know where this factor of sqrt(2) is coming from.


Compare SPECTRUM on screen with returned data:
raw = bytes from GPIB unpacked to integers
scaled = (raw*3.0103/512)-114.3914-inputLevel[dB]
data = 10^(scaled/20)
Then "data" winds up matching with SPECTRUM in units of Volts Pk.

Now we have to get to PSD:
Divide by sqrt(2) to get Vrms. Then divide by sqrt(2*linewidth)
